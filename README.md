# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting and analyzing customer lifetime value (CLV) using data science techniques. Customer lifetime value is a critical metric for businesses as it helps in understanding the long-term value associated with acquiring and retaining customers. By analyzing historical transactional data, we aim to build models that can predict future customer behavior and estimate their lifetime value.
